<h1>React Ecommerce Platform</h1>

<i>28/6/2020</i>
A react application I'm building, that is going to be a functioning ecommerce platform.

I'm planning on implementing features for adding to cart, deleting from cart, registering and logging in new users as well as making use of the stripe api to handle payments.

Now done with the basic layout, routing and product pages. I still need to fix minor routing issues with React Router (mostly experimenting with the 'exact'-attribute). Now I need to set up authentication with Firebase, as well as finishing a shopping cart-component, and Stripe API.
